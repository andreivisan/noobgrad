# NOOBGRAD

## What is it?
This is an experimental neural network engine built in order to learn ML and DL. 

Following the course of Andrew Ng on Coursera, I decided to build a neural network engine from scratch. I will not implement any optimizations in the beginning, just pure theory. 

## The name
Since I am a Noob in AI (by the definition of the great George Hotz) and also a big fan of tinygrad and micrograd I decided the name of this NN engine should be NOOBGRAD.

## The future
In the future I plan to optimize it as much as possible but still keeping it purely for education and practice purposes. Maybe integrate other models as well.
